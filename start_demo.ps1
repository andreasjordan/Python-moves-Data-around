# you actually want to demo - after a reboot, or when switching to this repository from the sibling
# one. 04_docker_compose.sh stops the sibling's containers first if they are running, because both
# repositories publish the same ports.
#
# It keeps all data: the volumes survive, so every table a demo wrote last time is still there. One
# thing to expect in "docker compose logs sqlserver" afterwards is a page of "already exists" errors
# - its init script runs on every start and its CREATE statements are unconditional. Harmless.

# The photoservice container restarts with the rest, which truncates its tables, empties the Kafka
# topic and restarts its schedule: the first order is 60 seconds from now, the first payment 90, the
# first shipment 120. Demos 4 and 6 are empty until then, and that looks broken when it is not.
