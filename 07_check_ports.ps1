# Does Windows see the container ports?
#
# 01_setup.ps1 does not run this. It is here for the moment its last step fails, because a connection
# refused from Windows almost never means the database is down. 127.0.0.1:1521 is docker's published
# port inside WSL2, but on Windows it is a listener that wslrelay creates a moment after docker binds
# the port in the VM - and the relay does not publish every port at the same moment. This has been
# seen with four forwards up and the fifth minutes late, while every container was running and
# answering inside WSL2 the whole time.
#
# Run it from a second PowerShell window while start_demo.ps1 sits in its WSL2 shell, or while
# 01_setup.ps1 is between its two connection tests.
#
# NO LISTENER means the forward is missing and the database is very probably fine - wait, or restart
# WSL2. If every port connects and a demo still cannot reach a database, then the network is fine and
# 06_test_connections.py is the next thing to run: it asks the drivers instead of the sockets.
#
# The keys are strings on purpose: an [ordered] dictionary indexed with an int looks up the position
# rather than the key, so numeric keys silently return nothing.
